  <h1>Welcome to the Applied Computer Science webApp!</h1>
  <p>This is my project for the <strong>Computer Networks</strong> exam for the summer session 2019. With this simple web application is possible to read the bulletin board and the blog of our <a href="https://informatica.uniurb.it/" target="_blank">offical website</a>. It's also possible to get the list of <a routerLink="/teachers">teachers</a> and contact them if you need some help or information. Finally, you can see which <a routerLink="/study-plan">subjects</a> you will be studying during the course.</p>
  <p>Just use the toolbar to navigate throught the application!</p>
  <h1>Some technical information</h1>
  <p>This web application was built with javascript using the <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_black"><i class="fab fa-angular"></i> Angular framework</a> and relies on a web service built with <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-node-js"></i> Node JS</a> which scrapes and fetch some data from the <a href="https://informatica.uniurb.it/" target="_blank">offical university website</a> and formats it in JSON.</p>
  <p>The web service project is available on <a href="https://github.com/damiandominella/cn-uni-api" target="_black"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> github</a> with documentation, so everyone can use it or improve it and build their proper application (maybe a mobile app)</p>
