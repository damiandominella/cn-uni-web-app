# Applied Computer Science - Uniurb - Web App

Computer network project for the summer session 2019.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

It relies on a [web service](https://github.com/damiandominella/cn-uni-api) that fetches and scrapes data from the [university website](https://informatica.uniurb.it/). 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
